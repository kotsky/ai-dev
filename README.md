# ai-dev


No numpy, no pandas, no sklearn. Only Hardcore. 

Own AI/ML algorithms implementation from scratch and its testing.

The reason I do that: it's simply to pick some cool powerful libs up and code ML model within just a few lines, which helps you to understand the concept. In my case, I want to design this concept.

There are:
- [regression](https://github.com/kotsky/ai-dev/regression): linear, non-linear, multi-variable.
- (later) classification: KNN? SVM?

To support data manipulation, I developed data_reader.py package instead of using pandas libs.
